# AGENTS.md

Project harness for reliable agent-assisted development.

## Startup Workflow

Before writing code:

1. **Confirm working directory** with `pwd`
2. **Read this file** completely
3. **Read project docs if present** (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/PRODUCT.md`, README, or equivalent)
4. **Run `./init.sh`** to verify environment is healthy
5. **Read `feature_list.json`** to see current feature state
6. **Review recent commits** with `git log --oneline -5`
7. **State your understanding**: In one line, what the task requires.
   If multiple interpretations exist, name them. If the ambiguity is structural
   (architecture, data model, security boundary, multi-module interaction),
   **stop and ask** — the cost of the wrong answer exceeds the round-trip.
   If the ambiguity is cosmetic or the safe default is clear, proceed and name
   your assumption.
8. **Write a scope boundary** (one line each):
   - **In scope:** the single feature/behavior the request names.
   - **Out of scope:** anything not named — extra modes, flags, commands, config,
     abstractions, or "while I'm here" improvements. If a change crosses this
     line, stop and ask before building it.
9. **Check Ponytail mode**: If the Ponytail skill is installed, confirm the
   current intensity level (`lite`, `full`, `ultra`). Default to `full` if unset.
   The level governs how aggressively the ladder is applied (see Coding Policy).

If baseline verification is failing, repair that first before adding new scope.

## Working Rules

- **One feature at a time**: Pick exactly one unfinished feature from `feature_list.json`
- **Verification required**: Don't claim done without running verification commands
- **Update artifacts**: Before ending session, update `progress.md` and `feature_list.json`
- **Stay in scope**: Don't modify files unrelated to the current feature
- **No bonus surface**: Build only what the request names. Do NOT add new CLI flags,
  commands, modes, config keys, or abstractions beyond the stated feature. If a
  useful extra occurs to you, name it in one line and ask — don't build it.
- **Leave clean state**: Next session must be able to run `./init.sh` immediately

## Editing Discipline

- **Touch only what the feature requires.** Do not "improve" or reformat adjacent
  code, comments, or whitespace — even when they could be better.
- **Match the existing style.** Consistency beats your preference.
- **Don't refactor things that aren't broken.** The diff's best outcome is getting shorter.
- **If you notice unrelated dead code or issues**, mention them in `progress.md` —
  don't fix them in this diff.
- **Remove only the imports, variables, or functions that YOUR changes made unused.**
  Do NOT remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
- **The test:** Every changed line should trace directly to the feature in
  `feature_list.json`.

## Required Artifacts

- `feature_list.json` — Feature state tracker (source of truth)
- `progress.md` — Session continuity log
- `init.sh` — Standard startup and verification path
- `session-handoff.md` — Optional, for larger sessions

## Definition of Done

A feature is done only when ALL of the following are true:

- [ ] Target behavior is implemented
- [ ] For bugs: a reproduction test was written FIRST, then made to pass
- [ ] For features: a verification check was written FIRST, then the code
- [ ] Required verification actually ran (tests / lint / type-check)
- [ ] Evidence recorded in `feature_list.json` or `progress.md`
- [ ] **Scope trace passed**: every changed line maps to the named feature; no
      bonus flags / commands / modes / abstractions were added (see Working Rules)
- [ ] Repository remains restartable from standard startup path

## End of Session

Before ending a session:

1. Update `progress.md` with current state
2. Update `feature_list.json` with new feature status
3. Record any unresolved risks or blockers
4. Commit with descriptive message once work is in safe state
5. Leave repo clean enough for next session to run `./init.sh` immediately

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Full verification (recommended)
./init.sh
```

Required checks:
- `echo "No package manifest detected; replace this line with your project verification command."`

## Coding Standards

- Write the **minimum code** that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
- No abstractions that weren't requested. No interface with one implementation.
  No factory for one product. No config for a value that never changes.
- No unrequested "flexibility" or "configurability." No scaffolding "for later" —
  later can scaffold for itself.
- No error handling for scenarios the code structure makes **impossible**
  (a dict key you just set 3 lines up doesn't need a KeyError handler).
- Deletion over addition. Boring over clever. Fewest files possible.
- Two stdlib options, same size? Pick the one that's correct on edge cases.
- Mark deliberate simplifications: `// ponytail: O(n²) scan, upgrade to index if >10k rows`

## Safety (Never Simplify Away)

- Input validation at trust boundaries
- Error handling that prevents data loss
- Security measures
- Accessibility basics
- Hardware calibration (a real clock drifts, a sensor reads off — the platform is
  never the spec ideal)
- Anything the user explicitly asked to keep

## Escalation

If you encounter:
- **Architecture decisions**: Consult project architecture docs if present, otherwise ask user
- **Unclear requirements**: Check product/requirements docs if present, otherwise ask user
- **Repeated test failures**: Update progress, flag for human review
- **Scope ambiguity**: Re-read `feature_list.json` for definition of done
- **Over-specified requirements**: Question whether the spec itself is over-specified
  before building; if a request includes features not asked for, build only the named
  part and flag the rest (see Working Rules: No bonus surface).
